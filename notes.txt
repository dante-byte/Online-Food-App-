mvnw and mvnw.cmd these are maven wrappers scripts you can use these scripts to build 
your project even if you don't have maven installed on your machine. 

pom.xml this is the maven build specitification 

FoodieCloudApplication.java this is spring boot main class that bootstraps 
the project 

application.properites - this file is initially empty, but offers 
a place where you can specify configuration properites 

static - this folder is where you can place any static content 
images stylesheets javascript, initially emepty 

templates tihs folder is where you'll place template files that 
will be used to render content to the browser. It's initially empty 
but you'll add a Thymeleaf template soon


FoodieCloudApplicationTest.java - this is a simple test class 
that ensures that the spring application  context loads 
successfully. You'll add more test to the mix as you develop 
the application. 

@SpringBootApplication  is  a  composite  application  that 
combines  three  otherannotations:

@SpringBootConfiguration—Designates  this  class  as  a  
configuration  class.Although  there’s  not  much  configuration 
in  the  class  yet,  you  can  add  Java-based Spring Framework 
configuration to this class if you need to. This annota-tion is,
in fact, a specialized form of the @Configuration
annotation.
@EnableAutoConfiguration—Enables  Spring  Boot  automatic
configuration.We’ll talk more about autoconfiguration later.
For now, know that this annota-tion tells Spring Boot to 
automatically configure any components that it 
thinksyou’ll need.@ComponentScan—Enables  component 
scanning.  This  lets  you  declare  otherclasses  with 
annotations  like
@Component, @Controller, @Service,  and 
others,to have Spring automatically discover them and register 
them as components inthe Spring application context.


@RunWith(SpringRunner.class). @RunWith isa JUnit annotation,
 providing a test runner that guides JUnit in running a test. 
 ThinkListing 1.3   A baseline application testUses the
  Spring runnerA Spring Boot testThe test method of it as 
  applying a plugin to JUnit to provide custom testing behavior. 
  In this case,JUnit is given SpringRunner, a Spring-provided
   test runner that provides for the cre-ation of a Spring 
   application context that the test will run against
